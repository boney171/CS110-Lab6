<h1 style="font-size:2em;">📫 Messenger Chat App</h1>

Welcome to the repository for the Messenger Chat App, a real-time chat application brought to you by Team Paws & Claws.

This application is split into two parts: a frontend website and a backend server.

The frontend of the Messenger Chat App is deployed and hosted using Netlify, a platform offering hosting and serverless backend services for web applications and static websites. You can visit our frontend [here](https://main--gilded-dango-efff41.netlify.app/).

The backend server of the Messenger Chat App is hosted using Heroku, a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. You can visit our backend [here](https://tri-messenger-chat-app.herokuapp.com/).
